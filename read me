# Delhi District Flood Risk Prediction (ConvLSTM)

This project aims to predict district-wise flood risk probability in Delhi using
spatiotemporal deep learning (CNN + ConvLSTM).

## Objective
- Use hourly rainfall, soil moisture, and the Yamuna river levels
- Combine with static geospatial layers (DEM, LULC, slope, drainage density)
- Output flood probability grids aggregated to districts

## Data Sources
- IMD / GPM: Hourly rainfall
- SMAP / GLDAS: Soil moisture
- CWC: Yamuna river water levels
- Cartosat DEM
- NRSC LULC
- Delhi district boundaries (GIS)

## Model Approach
- CNN for spatial feature extraction
- ConvLSTM for temporal dependency (12–24 hr sequences)
- Sigmoid probability output
- District-level aggregation via spatial pooling

## Status
- Project initialized
- Data source identification completed
- Model architecture design in progress

## Planned Outputs
- GeoJSON with district flood probabilities
- Interactive flood risk map (Folium)
- Trained ConvLSTM model weights
